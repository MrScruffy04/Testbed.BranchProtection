        <p>
          All the world’s a stage,<br/>
          And all the men and women merely players;<br/>
          They have their exits and their entrances;<br/>
          And one man in his time plays many parts,<br/>
          His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br/>
          Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;<br/>
          And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<br/>
          And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br/>
          Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br/>
          Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br/>
          Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br/>
          Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,<br/>
          Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br/>
          Seeking the bubble reputation<br/>
          Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br/>
          In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,<br/>
          With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br/>
          Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br/>
          And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br/>
          Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,<br/>
          With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br/>
          His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide<br/>
          For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br/>
          Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br/>
          And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br/>
          That ends this strange eventful history,<br/>
          Is second childishness and mere oblivion;<br/>
          Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
